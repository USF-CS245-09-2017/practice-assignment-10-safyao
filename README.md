Comments:
For the most part, my code follows Professor Brizan's recommendations for the general structure of graphs that he provided in class. However, though he intended for the neighbors() function to return a List<Integer>, I just kept mine as the Practice Assignment required (a general array). Because of this choice, I have to grow my neighbor array one size bigger every time I add a neighbor in order for it to pass the Practice10Test.
